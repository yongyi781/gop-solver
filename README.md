This is a C++ solver for Great Orb Project. It can find the way to score 1 or more orbs in the least number of ticks.

## What is the Great Orb Project?

The Great Orb Project is a minigame in RuneScape released in August 2008. It was competitively active between 2009 and 2015. The gameplay is that there are 2 teams, yellow and green. The game is divided into 6 two-minute sections, and the winner of each section is decided by who scores more orbs into the altar in that time. Since RuneScape is a discrete square-based tick-based game, it is possible to optimize how to score a given combination of 3 orbs. This is what this program does.
